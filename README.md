- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zanni, James or @jr_ff_n on Twitter.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all about web development and blockchain.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, primarily through Frontend Masters!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...well, probably not much yet as I'm still in the very early stages of learning, but always open to opportunities.
- 📫 I can be reached on twitter!
